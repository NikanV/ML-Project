# ML Project: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Neural Style Transfer (NST)

This repository contains the projects developed during a Machine Learning course, with a focus on deep learning techniques. The project is divided into two main phases:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification**:
   - This phase involves the implementation and training of a Convolutional Neural Network for later image classification and NST tasks. The project includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

2. **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**:
   - In this phase, we explore the fascinating technique of Neural Style Transfer by using the VGG19 model, where the style of one image is applied to the content of another image using a pre-trained deep learning model. This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to create visually stunning artistic effects by combining content and style from different images.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib, torch, etc.
